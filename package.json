Check the \"Snow\" tab in the menu bar at the top(Probably moving those at some point)\nExtensions - A set of extension methods that add simple functionality like checking if a layer mask contains a layer, or getting colors from gradients\nFileTools - Tools for reading and writing to files on disk(Currently JSON only)\nHashNoise - A small RNG that uses noise to produce fast and good randomness. \nOption Tools - A series of tools used for managing game settings using PlayerPrefs.\nRouter - Tools for creating menu systems using a stack that includes for the ability to call a back function and go to the previous menu.\nScriptableObjectExtension - ScriptableObject containers for primitive types used for sharing decoupled runtime data \nSimpleTools - Basic debugging tools like, simple sphere and box gizmos.\nTimer Tools - Simple Timer and Itterator tools for delayed execution without coroutines using callbacks\nUI Tools - A series of tools to help manage layouts by calcualting the size for child objects.",
